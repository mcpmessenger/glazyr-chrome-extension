# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, contact the maintainers via GitHub (or your preferred private channel) with:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment (what an attacker could do)

We will acknowledge receipt and work on a fix as soon as possible.
