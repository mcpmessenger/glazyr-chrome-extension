# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Quick start

- **Install/Run**: load `dist/` via `chrome://extensions/` → **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked**
- **Keep changes focused**: ideally one feature/fix per PR.

## Project layout

- `dist/`: packaged extension Chrome loads (manifest, service worker, content scripts, popup, icons)
- `tools/`: helper scripts (ex: icon generation, packaging)

## Pull requests

- Describe what changed and why.
- Include steps to validate (manual or automated).
- If you changed permissions in `dist/manifest.json`, call it out explicitly in the PR description.
